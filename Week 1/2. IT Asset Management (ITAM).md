# 🖥️ IT Asset Management (ITAM)

## 📌 What is IT Asset Management?
**IT Asset Management (ITAM)** is the practice of tracking, managing, and optimizing an organization’s IT assets throughout their **lifecycle** — from procurement to disposal.

## 🎯 Objectives of ITAM
1. **Visibility** – Maintain a single, accurate inventory of all IT assets.  
2. **Compliance** – Ensure software/hardware follows licensing and regulatory requirements.  
3. **Optimization** – Maximize usage of existing resources, reduce redundancy.  
4. **Risk Management** – Identify outdated, vulnerable, or unsupported assets.  
5. **Cost Control** – Avoid overspending on unused licenses, shadow IT, or premature upgrades.

## ⚠️ Challenges in ITAM
- Incomplete or outdated inventories  
- Multiple, siloed tools without integration  
- Difficulty tracking **remote devices and SaaS apps**  
- Manual effort in lifecycle and compliance reporting

- Automate **discovery and inventory updates**.  
- Map ownership: **business owner, technical owner, support group**.  
- Regularly review **EOL/EOS/EOM** reports to prevent obsolescence risk.  
- Integrate ITAM with **security operations** for proactive vulnerability management.
