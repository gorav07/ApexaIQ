# 🧠 ApexaiQ’s Agentless Architecture

## 🚀 Overview
**ApexaiQ** is built on an **agentless, cloud-native architecture** designed to give organizations **real-time asset visibility** without installing software on endpoints.  
Instead of deploying agents, ApexaiQ collects data through **network-side integrations, APIs, and protocol-based discovery**, ensuring faster rollout and broader device coverage.

## 🏗️ Key Design Principles

1. **Agentless by Design**
   - No software agents installed on endpoints.
   - Uses **standard network protocols** (e.g., SNMP, SSH, WMI, API calls) for data collection.
   - Simplifies deployment, reduces maintenance overhead, and ensures scalability.

2. **Continuous Discovery**
   - Continuously scans the network and cloud environments to identify new or changing assets.
   - Detects servers, endpoints, IoT, OT, and virtual/cloud assets.
   - Supports **dynamic IT environments** where assets frequently join or leave.

3. **Integration-Driven Data Collection**
   - Connects directly to existing IT and security tools (e.g., Active Directory, SCCM, AWS, Azure, MDM, CMDB).
   - Uses **API-based collectors** and **log data** to enrich asset intelligence.
   - Enables **bidirectional integrations** for both inbound and outbound data exchange.

4. **Centralized SaaS Control Plane**
   - Cloud-based architecture with a unified console for asset visibility, risk analytics, and automation.
   - Provides multi-tenant support for **MSPs (Managed Service Providers)** and large enterprises.
   - Ensures compliance and scalability across distributed networks.

## ⚙️ How It Works (High-Level Flow)

1. **Discovery**
   - Identifies devices using **network scanning**, **DNS**, **DHCP**, and **directory integrations**.
   - Detects both managed and unmanaged assets.

2. **Data Collection**
   - Gathers information through **protocols and APIs**, not endpoint agents.
   - Pulls details like OS, installed software, patch levels, warranty, and configuration data.

3. **Normalization & Enrichment**
   - Deduplicates and normalizes asset records.
   - Enriches with external intelligence such as:
     - **EOL/EOS** (End of Life / End of Support)
     - **NVD vulnerabilities (CVEs)**
     - **Compliance baselines (CISA, ISO 27001, HIPAA, etc.)**

4. **Risk Scoring**
   - Computes the **ApexaiQ Risk Score** for each asset based on:
     - Criticality
     - Vulnerabilities
     - Obsolescence
     - Compliance gaps

5. **Automation & Remediation**
   - Triggers automated workflows via **outbound integrations** (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira, SCCM).
   - Enables **policy-based remediation** such as patching, ticket creation, or configuration updates.

## 🧩 Advantages of Agentless Architecture

| Advantage | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **No Installation Required** | Eliminates the need to deploy and maintain agents. |
| **Broad Coverage** | Works across all device types — even IoT, OT, and unmanaged endpoints. |
| **Low Overhead** | No impact on endpoint performance. |
| **Faster Time-to-Value** | Rapid onboarding and discovery. |
| **Unified Visibility** | One console for all assets — on-prem, cloud, and edge. |
| **Scalable & Secure** | Cloud-native architecture with enterprise-grade security. |

---

## ⚠️ Limitations (and How ApexaiQ Mitigates Them)

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|------------|-------------|
| Limited visibility into offline devices | ApexaiQ integrates historical and log-based data to fill gaps. |
| Credential management overhead | Secure vault-based credential handling and API tokens. |
| Network dependency | Optimized collectors and bandwidth throttling ensure minimal impact. |
