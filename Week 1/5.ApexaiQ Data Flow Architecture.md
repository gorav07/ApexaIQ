# 🔄 ApexaiQ Data Flow Architecture

![Flow Diagram](FlowOfData.jpeg)

The diagram represents the **end-to-end data flow** across ApexaiQ’s architecture — from **inputs (security tools)** to **outputs (processed asset intelligence)** — along with associated controls and best practices.

---

## 🧱 1. Security Tools (Your Network)

**Inputs:**  
- Firewalls, EDR/AV, scanners, SIEM, MDM, hypervisors, cloud APIs  

**Outputs to ApexaiQ:**  
- Raw inventories, alerts, posture data  

**Controls:**  
- API scopes  
- Service accounts  
- Network allowlists  

---

## 🛰️ 2. ApexaiQ Collector

**What:**  
- Network-side component that aggregates data from local systems  

**How:**  
- Scheduled pulls  
- Event subscriptions  
- Secure forwarding through firewall  

**Controls:**  
- Certificate pinning  
- TLS encryption  
- Credential vaulting  
- Egress rules  

**Pitfalls:**  
- Over-privileged connectors  
- Missing proxy or firewall rules  

---

## ⚙️ 3. Pre-Feed Rules (Automatic)

**What:**  
- Cleans, normalizes, and deduplicates data before it reaches the main data store  

**How:**  
- Schema mapping  
- Value standardization  
- Key matching  

**Outputs:**  
- Canonical fields: `owner`, `device ID`, `OS`, `version`, `location`  

**Pitfalls:**  
- Over-aggressive deduplication  
- Loss of source attribution  

---

## 🧭 4. ApexaiQ Dashboard (SaaS)

**What:**  
- Central control plane for **search, analytics, orchestration, and reporting**  

**How:**  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Saved views and dashboards  
- Drill-down analytics  

**Metrics:**  
- User activity  
- Query latency  
- Report freshness  

---

## 💻 5. Processed Feed → Devices

**What:**  
- Catalog of all discovered devices (endpoints, servers, network/IoT)  

**How:**  
- Tracks asset states (active/inactive)  
- Ownership and location tagging  
- Compliance classification  

**Controls:**  
- Unique IDs via hardware signatures and source reconciliation  

---

## 👤 6. Processed Feed → Users

**What:**  
- Identity mapping between IdP/HRIS data and endpoint or SaaS entitlements  

**How:**  
- Email/UPN correlation  
- Group membership mapping  

**Controls:**  
- Orphan account detection  
- Automated leaver/offboarding process  

---

## 💿 7. Processed Feed → Software

**What:**  
- Software inventory including installations, versions, and licenses  

**How:**  
- Normalization to product catalog entries  
- End-of-Life (EOL) / End-of-Support (EOS) checks  

**Controls:**  
- Software blacklists/whitelists  
- Unsupported software flagging  

---

## 🧩 8. Enrich Rules (Your Input)

**What:**  
- Custom enrichment logic for business-specific priorities  

**How:**  
- Attribute-based conditions  
- Reference tables (e.g., “Crown Jewels” list)  

**Outputs:**  
- Enriched asset records for routing, prioritization, and risk scoring  

---

## ⚡ 9. Accelerator & Integration

**Accelerator:**  
- Prebuilt connectors, default mappings, and starter policies  

**Integrations:**  
- Outbound to ITSM, SOAR, MDM/EDR, configuration management, and CMDB systems  

**Controls:**  
- Bidirectional sync testing  
- Conflict resolution strategy  

---

## 🛡️ Operational Controls Across the Flow

- **Logging & Monitoring** – Continuous activity and security audit logs  
- **Change Management** – Version control and peer reviews for rule updates  
- **Data Retention** – Configurable storage lifecycle and archival policies  
- **Privacy Masking** – Sensitive data redaction in logs and exports  
- **Access Reviews** – Scheduled review of API tokens and admin roles  
- **Disaster Recovery Tests** – Regular failover and data recovery validation
