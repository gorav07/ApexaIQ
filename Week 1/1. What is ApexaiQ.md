# 🧠 ApexaiQ and IT Asset Management

## Overview
**ApexaiQ** is a **SaaS-based, agentless asset assurance platform** that gives IT leaders **real-time visibility** into all hardware and software assets — along with the **risks associated** with them.  

It continuously discovers devices such as:
- Servers  
- Endpoints  
- Network gear  
- IoT and OT devices  

ApexaiQ enriches asset data with additional context, including:
- Warranty status  
- End-of-life (EOL) and end-of-support (EOS) dates  
- Known vulnerabilities (e.g., **NVD CVEs**)  

---

## 🔍 Risk Scoring
ApexaiQ computes a proprietary **ApexaiQ Risk Score** for each asset based on:
- Business criticality  
- Vulnerabilities  
- Obsolescence  
- Compliance gaps  

This enables organizations to **prioritize remediation** — including patching, upgrades, and maintenance — for their most at-risk assets.

- Fragmented and inconsistent asset data
